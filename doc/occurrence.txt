A Neovim plugin to mark occurrences of words/patterns in a buffer and perform
operations on them.

Inspired by vim-mode-plus
<https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus?tab=readme-ov-file#some-features>’s
occurrence feature.


==============================================================================
1. Installation                                      *occurrence-installation*


USING LAZY.NVIM                      *occurrence-installation-using-lazy.nvim*

>lua
    {
      "occurrence.nvim",
      event = "BufReadPost", -- If you want to lazy load
      opts = {} -- It is not neccessary to define any options or call `setup()`
    }
<


USING PACKER.NVIM                  *occurrence-installation-using-packer.nvim*

>lua
    use {
      "occurrence.nvim",
      config = function()
        require("occurrence").setup()
      end,
    }
<


==============================================================================
2. Quick Start                                        *occurrence-quick-start*

With the default configuration, you can try these workflows to get a feel for
`occurrence.nvim`.


OPERATOR-PENDING MODE           *occurrence-quick-start-operator-pending-mode*

You can modify most vim operators to work on occurrences of the word under
cursor:

1. **Choose operator**: Start an operation like `c`, `d`, `y`
2. **Modify operator**: Press `o` to enter occurrence operator-modifier mode
3. **Choose range**: Use vim motions like `$`, `ip`, etc. to apply to occurrences in that range


OCCURRENCE MODE                       *occurrence-quick-start-occurrence-mode*

Alternatively, you can first mark occurrences and then operate on them.


MARKING OCCURRENCES ~

Marking occurrences can be done in several ways:

- **Word under cursor**: Place cursor on a word and press `go` in normal mode
- **Visual selection**: Select text in visual mode and press `go`
- **Last search pattern**: After searching with `/pattern` or `?pattern`, press `go` in normal mode

Once occurrences are marked, you can navigate, add and remove them:

- **Navigate**: Use `n`/`N` to jump between marked occurrences, or `gn`/`gN` for all occurrences
- **Mark individual**: `ga` to mark current occurrence, `gx` to unmark
- **Toggle mark**: `go` to toggle mark on current occurrence


OPERATING ON MARKED OCCURRENCES ~

With occurrences marked, you can perform operations on them in several ways:

1. **Choose operation**: Use vim operators like `c` (change), `d` (delete), `y` (yank) on marked occurrences
2. **Choose range**: Use vim motions like `$`, `ip`, etc. to apply operator to occurrences in that range

Or, you can use visual mode:

1. **Start visual mode**: Press `v` to enter visual mode, or `V` for visual line mode
2. **Select range**: Use vim motions to select a range
3. **Choose operation**: Use vim operators like `c` (change), `d` (delete), `y` (yank) on marked occurrences in the visual range.

When you’re done, press `<Esc>` to exit occurrence mode and clear all marks.

3. Configuration                                    *occurrence-configuration*


DEFAULT CONFIGURATION         *occurrence-configuration-default-configuration*

>lua
    require("occurrence").setup({
      -- Enable default keymaps (go, n, N, gn, gN, ga, gx, etc.)
      default_keymaps = true,
    
      -- Enable default operator support (c, d, y, p, gp, <, >, =, gu, gU, g~, g?)
      default_operators = true,
    
      -- Operator configurations
      operators = {
        ["c"] = "change",             -- Change marked occurrences
        ["d"] = "delete",             -- Delete marked occurrences
        ["y"] = "yank",               -- Yank marked occurrences
        ["p"] = "put",                -- Put register at marked occurrences
        ["gp"] = "distribute",        -- Distribute lines from register across occurrences
        ["<"] = "indent_left",        -- Indent left
        [">"] = "indent_right",       -- Indent right
        ["="] = "indent_format",      -- Indent/format
        ["gu"] = "lowercase",         -- Convert to lowercase
        ["gU"] = "uppercase",         -- Convert to uppercase
        ["g~"] = "swap_case",         -- Swap case
        ["g?"] = "rot13",             -- ROT13 encoding
      },
    
      -- Optional: callback when occurrence mode activates
      -- Receives a keymap function: `map(mode, lhs, rhs, opts)`
      -- This function can be used to set up custom keymaps that are only active in occurrence mode.
      -- Keymaps that are set through this function will automatically be removed when occurrence mode deactivates.
      on_activate = nil,
    })
<

**Default Keymaps** (when `default_keymaps = true`):

Normal/Visual mode:

- `go` - Find and mark occurrences (word/selection/search pattern)

Operator-pending mode:

- `o` - Occurrence operator modifier (e.g., `coip`, `do$`)

Occurrence mode (after marking occurrences from normal/visual mode):

- `n` / `N` - Next/previous marked occurrence
- `gn` / `gN` - Next/previous occurrence (all matches)
- `go` - Toggle mark on current occurrence or mark new word
- `ga` - Mark current occurrence
- `gx` - Unmark current occurrence
- `<Esc>`, `<C-c>`, `<C-[>` - Exit occurrence mode
- All configured operators (`c`, `d`, `y`, `p`, `gp`, `<`, `>`, `=`, `gu`, `gU`, `g~`, `g?`)


CUSTOM CONFIGURATION EXAMPLES*occurrence-configuration-custom-configuration-examples*


MINIMAL CONFIGURATION ~

Disable default keymaps and set up custom ones:

>lua
    require("occurrence").setup({
      default_keymaps = false,  -- Disable default keymaps
      on_activate = function(map)
        -- NOTE: If you disable default keymaps
        -- you'll want a way to exit occurrence mode!
        map("n", "q", "<Plug>(OccurrenceDeactivate)")
      end,
    })
    
    -- Set up custom keymaps using <Plug> mappings
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>o", "<Plug>(OccurrenceCurrent)")
    
    -- Or using the `:Occurrence` command:
    vim.keymap.set("v", "<C-o>", ":Occurrence selection<CR>")
    
    -- Or using Lua API:
    vim.keymap.set("o", "<C-o>", function()
      require('occurrence').modify_operator()
    end)
<


CUSTOM KEYMAPS ~

>lua
    require("occurrence").setup({
      default_keymaps = false,  -- Disable defaults
      on_activate = function(map)
        -- Custom navigation
        map("n", "<Tab>", "<Plug>(OccurrenceNext)")
        map("n", "<S-Tab>", "<Plug>(OccurrencePrevious)")
    
        -- Batch operations
        map("n", "<leader>a", function()
          require('occurrence').mark_all()
        end)
        map("n", "<leader>x", function()
          require('occurrence').unmark_all()
        end)
    
        -- Exit
        map("n", "q", "<Plug>(OccurrenceDeactivate)")
      end,
    })
    
    -- Entry keymap
    vim.keymap.set({ "n", "v" }, "<leader>o", "<Plug>(OccurrenceCurrent)")
<


DISABLE SPECIFIC OPERATORS ~

>lua
    require("occurrence").setup({
      operators = {
        ["c"] = "change",
        ["d"] = "delete",
        ["y"] = "yank",
        ["g?"] = false,  -- Disable ROT13
        ["g~"] = false,  -- Disable swap case
      },
    })
<


CUSTOM LINE-BASED OPERATORS ~

Add operators that work on marked occurrences on the current line:

>lua
    require("occurrence").setup({
      on_activate = function(map)
        -- dd - Delete marked occurrences on current line
        map("n", "dd", function()
          local occ = require('occurrence.Occurrence').get()
          local range = require("occurrence.Range").of_line()
          occ:apply_operator("delete", range, "line")
        end, { desc = "Delete marked occurrences on line" })
    
        -- D - Delete marked occurrences from cursor to end of line
        map("n", "D", function()
          local occ = require("occurrence.Occurrence").get()
          occ:apply_operator("delete", "$")
        end, { desc = "Delete marked occurrences from cursor to end of line" })
    
        -- cc - Change marked occurrences on current line
        map("n", "cc", function()
          local occ = require('occurrence.Occurrence').get()
          local range = require("occurrence.Range").of_line()
          occ:apply_operator("change", range, "line")
        end, { desc = "Change marked occurrences on line" })
    
        -- C - Change marked occurrences from cursor to end of line
        map("n", "C", function()
          local occ = require("occurrence.Occurrence").get()
          occ:apply_operator("change", "$")
        end, { desc = "Change marked occurrences from cursor to end of line" })
      end,
    })
<


CUSTOMIZING HIGHLIGHTS       *occurrence-configuration-customizing-highlights*

occurrence.nvim uses three highlight groups for visual feedback:

- **OccurrenceMatch**: Highlights all occurrence matches (default: links to `Search`)
- **OccurrenceMark**: Highlights marked occurrences that will be operated on (default: links to `IncSearch`)
- **OccurrenceCurrent**: Highlights the current occurrence under the cursor (default: links to `CurSearch`)

You can customize these highlight groups in your configuration:

>lua
    -- Example: Bold and underlined for emphasis
    vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "OccurrenceMatch", {})
    vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "OccurrenceMark", { bold = true, underline = true })
    vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "OccurrenceCurrent", { bold = true, underline = true, reverse = true })
<


STATUSLINE INTEGRATION       *occurrence-configuration-statusline-integration*

Display occurrence count in your statusline similar to Neovim’s search count
using the `status()` API:

>lua
    -- Example: lualine component
    local function occurrence_status()
      local count = require('occurrence').status()
      if not count then
        return ""
      end
      return string.format("[%d/%d]", count.current, count.total)
    end
    
    require('lualine').setup({
      sections = {
        lualine_c = { 'filename', occurrence_status },
      }
    })
<

>lua
    -- Example: statusline function with icons
    function _G.occurrence_statusline()
      local count = require('occurrence').status({ marked = true })
      if not count then
        return ""
      end
    
      local icon = count.exact_match == 1 and "" or "󰍉"
      return string.format("%s %d/%d", icon, count.current, count.total)
    end
    
    -- Add to your statusline
    vim.opt.statusline = "%f %{%v:lua.occurrence_statusline()%}"
<

**API: require('occurrence').status(opts)**

Returns `nil` if no active occurrence, otherwise returns:

- `current` (integer): Current match index (1-based)
- `total` (integer): Total number of matches
- `exact_match` (integer): 1 if cursor is on a match, 0 otherwise
- `marked_only` (boolean): Whether counting only marked occurrences

Options:

- `marked` (boolean): Count only marked occurrences (default: false)
- `buffer` (integer): Buffer number (default: current buffer)

4. Example Workflows                            *occurrence-example-workflows*

Some examples of real-world workflows using `occurrence.nvim`.


EXAMPLE: SELECTIVE EDITING*occurrence-example-workflows-example:-selective-editing*

Change only some occurrences of a word:

>vim
    " Buffer: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
    "         The fox is quick and the dog is lazy.
    "         Another fox and dog appear here.
    
    go          " Mark all occurrences of 'fox' (cursor on first 'fox')
    n           " Navigate to next occurrence (line 2)
    gx          " Unmark this one (skip it)
    n           " Navigate to next (line 3)
    cip         " 'c'hange marked occurrences 'i'n 'p'aragraph
    wolf        " Type replacement
    <Esc>       " Exit and clear marks
    
    " Result: 'fox' on lines 1 and 3 changed to 'wolf', line 2 unchanged
<


EXAMPLE: WORKING WITH SEARCH PATTERNS*occurrence-example-workflows-example:-working-with-search-patterns*

Mark occurrences from last search pattern:

>vim
    " Buffer: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
    "         The fox is quick and the dog is lazy.
    "         Another fox and dog appear here.
    
    /\<...\>    " Search for 3-letter words (the, fox, the, dog, and)
    go          " Mark all occurrences matching the search pattern
    gggUG       " Uppercase all marked occurrences: 'gg' to start, 'gU' uppercase, 'G' to end
    
    " Result: THE quick brown FOX jumps over THE lazy DOG.
    "         THE FOX is quick AND THE DOG is lazy.
    "         Another FOX AND DOG appear here.
<


EXAMPLE: WORKING WITH MULTIPLE PATTERNS*occurrence-example-workflows-example:-working-with-multiple-patterns*

Mark different words and edit them together:

>vim
    " Buffer: foo is here and bar is there
    "         foo and bar together
    "         only foo here
    "         only bar there
    
    go          " Mark all 'foo' occurrences (cursor on first 'foo')
    j2w         " Move cursor to 'bar' on line 2
    go          " Mark all 'bar' occurrences as well
    cip         " 'c'hange all marked occurrences 'i'n 'p'aragraph
    test<CR>    " Type replacement
    <Esc>       " Exit
    
    " Result: test is here and test is there
    "         test and test together
    "         only test here
    "         only test there
<


EXAMPLE: YANKING AND PUTTING OCCURRENCES*occurrence-example-workflows-example:-yanking-and-putting-occurrences*

Yank marked occurrences and paste at different locations:

>vim
    " Buffer: SOURCE SOURCE SOURCE
    "         dest dest dest
    
    go          " Mark 'SOURCE' occurrences (cursor on first SOURCE)
    y$          " Yank all marked occurrences to end of line
    <Esc>       " Exit occurrence mode
    j^          " Move to line 2, first column
    go          " Mark all 'dest' occurrences
    p$          " Put yanked content at all marked locations
    
    " Result: Multi-line content replaces each dest
    "         Each dest becomes: SOURCE
    "                            SOURCE
    "                            SOURCE
<


EXAMPLE: DISTRIBUTING VALUES*occurrence-example-workflows-example:-distributing-values*

The `distribute` operator (`gp`) cycles through lines from a register when
pasting, giving each occurrence a different value. This is useful for
refactoring or batch renaming with distinct values.

>vim
    " Buffer: alpha foo beta bar gamma bat
    "         foo dest bar dest bat dest
    
    " 1. Mark and yank source values using search pattern
    /\(alpha\|beta\|gamma\)<CR>  " Search for the three values
    go                           " Mark all matching occurrences
    Vy                           " Yank marked values (creates "alpha\nbeta\ngamma")
    <Esc>                        " Exit occurrence mode
    
    " 2. Distribute values to destinations
    /\(foo\|bar\|bat\)<CR>       " Search for the three dest values
    go                           " Mark all matching occurrences
    jVgp                         " Move to line2 and Distribute - cycles through yanked lines
    
    " Result: alpha foo beta bar gamma bat
    "         alpha dest beta dest gamma dest
    " (Each dest gets a different value: first->alpha, second->beta, third->gamma)
<

**Difference between p and gp:**

- `p` (put): Replicates the same text at each occurrence
- `gp` (distribute): Cycles through lines in the register, giving each occurrence a different line


==============================================================================
5. API Reference                                    *occurrence-api-reference*


LUA API                                     *occurrence-api-reference-lua-api*

occurrence.nvim provides a Lua API for programmatic control:


REQUIRE('OCCURRENCE').SETUP(OPTS) ~

Configure the plugin. See |occurrence-configuration| for available options.

**Note:** calling `setup()` is **not required** unless you intend to customize
settings!


REQUIRE('OCCURRENCE').STATUS(OPTS) ~

Get occurrence count information for statusline (or other) integrations.

**Parameters:**

- `opts` (table, optional):
    - `marked` (boolean): Count only marked occurrences (default: `false`)
    - `buffer` (integer): Buffer number (default: current buffer)

**Returns:**

- `nil` if no active occurrence
- Table with fields:
    - `current` (integer): Current match index (1-based)
    - `total` (integer): Total number of matches
    - `exact_match` (integer): 1 if cursor is exactly on a match, 0 otherwise
    - `marked_only` (boolean): Whether counting only marked occurrences

**Example:**

>lua
    local count = require('occurrence').status()
    if count then
      print(string.format("Match %d of %d", count.current, count.total))
    end
<


ACTIONS                                     *occurrence-api-reference-actions*

All actions are available in three ways:

- **Lua API**: `require('occurrence').<action>()`
- **Vim commands**: `:Occurrence <action>`
- ** mappings**: `<Plug>(Occurrence<Action>)`

**Example usage:**

>lua
    local occurrence = require('occurrence')
    
    -- Entry actions (activate occurrence mode)
    occurrence.word()      -- Mark word under cursor
    occurrence.current()   -- Smart: selection, pattern, or word
    
    -- Navigation (when occurrence mode is active)
    occurrence.next()      -- Next marked occurrence
    occurrence.mark()      -- Mark current occurrence
    occurrence.deactivate() -- Exit occurrence mode
<


ENTRY ACTIONS ~
