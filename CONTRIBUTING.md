- Share minimal test cases when possible

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Make your changes following the guidelines below
4. Write or update tests as needed
5. Ensure all tests pass: `make test` (see [Testing](#testing) section)
6. Update documentation if needed
7. Submit a pull request

## Development Guidelines

### Commit Message Convention

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for automated changelog generation.

#### Quick Setup

**1. Install git hooks for local validation:**

```bash
make install-hooks
```

This installs a [commit-msg](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_commit_msg) hook that validates your commit messages locally before they're committed.

**2. Set up the commit message template (optional but recommended):**

```bash
git config commit.template .gitmessage
```

Now when you run `git commit` (without `-m`), your editor will open with the template pre-filled with examples and guidelines.

#### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

#### Type

Must be one of:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **build**: Changes to build system or dependencies
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit

#### Scope

Optional. Can be anything specifying the place of the commit change:

- `api` - API changes
- `config` - Configuration changes
- `operators` - Operator-related changes
- `actions` - Action-related changes
- `keymap` - Keymap changes
- `extmarks` - Extmark/highlighting changes
- `tests` - Test-related changes
- `docs` - Documentation changes

#### Subject

- Use imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- Don't capitalize the first letter
- No period (.) at the end
- Limit to 72 characters

#### Body

Optional. Provide additional context about the change:

- Explain the motivation for the change
- Contrast this with previous behavior
- Use imperative, present tense

#### Footer

Optional. Reference issues and include breaking changes:

- Reference issues: `Fixes #123`, `Closes #456`
- Breaking changes: Start with `BREAKING CHANGE:` followed by description

### Code Style

- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Format code with [stylua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua)
- Add [LuaCATS](https://luals.github.io/wiki/annotations/) type annotations for public APIs

### Testing

Setup local [luarocks](https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks/wiki/Download) environment and run tests:

```bash
# Run all tests (will install dependencies if needed)
make test

# Run performance tests only
make test-perf
```

- Write tests for new features using [busted](https://lunarmodules.github.io/busted/)
- Ensure existing tests pass: `make test`
- Add performance tests for performance-critical features
- Run tests in isolation: `make test tests/path/to/test_spec.lua`

### Documentation

- Update [README.md](README.md) for user-facing changes
- Add/update LuaCATS annotations for API changes
- Regenerate vim help: `make doc`
- Document breaking changes clearly
- Add examples for new features

## Release Process

Releases are **fully automated** using [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please):

### How It Works

1. **Commit to main**: Push commits following [Conventional Commits](#commit-message-convention) to the `main` branch
2. **Automatic PR Creation**: Release Please automatically:
   - Analyzes commits since last release
   - Determines next version based on commit types (feat = minor, fix = patch, breaking = major)
   - Generates/updates CHANGELOG.md
   - Creates a "Release PR" with all changes
3. **Review and Merge**: Review the Release PR and merge when ready
4. **Automatic Release**: On merge, Release Please:
   - Creates a GitHub release with the changelog
   - Tags the release (e.g., `v1.2.3`)
   - Triggers the release workflow (tests + publish)

### Version Bumping Rules

Release Please uses commit types to determine version bumps:

- `feat:` → Minor version bump (0.1.0 → 0.2.0)
- `fix:`, `perf:` → Patch version bump (0.1.0 → 0.1.1)
- `feat!:`, `fix!:`, or `BREAKING CHANGE:` → Major version bump (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)
- `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:` → No version bump (included in next release)

## Getting Help

- Check existing documentation in [README.md](README.md) or `:h occurrence`
- Search closed issues for similar questions
- Open a new issue with your question
